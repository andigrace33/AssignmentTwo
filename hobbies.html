    <h2>Here are some of my favourte hobbies:</h2>
    <!--running-->
    <h2><u>Running</u></h2>
    <p1>If you have already seen "My Projects" then you already know that I started a running group.
        However, I also like to run! Last year after several months of training, I was able to 
        finish my first ultramarathon and traditional marathon (approx 42 Kilometres). I plan on doing 
        many more running events this year. 
    </p1>

    <p2>This is a picture of me at the finish line of the Regina Marathon. This was a lifetime
        goal and a huge deal for me to be able to complete 42 kilometres.

    <!--nature-->
    <h2><u>Nature</u></h2>
    <p3>I love nature! I love being outside and taking pictures of flowers and insects. 
        In my opinion, a day inside is a day wasted. If I see the sun, I'll be outside! I 
        have a pair of walking poles that I like to use outside no matter the weather.
    </p3>
    <img class="trees" src="nature.jpg" alt="Trees Photo" title="Trees Photo" width="500" height="350" />
    <p4>Here's a photo I took of snow-filled trees in January in Saskatchewan.

    <!--animals-->
    <h2><u>Animals</u></h2>
    <p5>Throughout my entire life, I have had pets. My first pet was a guinea pig. I have had
        mice, rats, gerbils, a skink (lizard), a bird, hermit crabs and many more. I 
        currently have a cat named Nellie. My partner and I adopted her from the shelter a week
        before Halloween this year. She is an absolute joy and terror all at the same time. 
    </p5>

    <p6>Nellie is the number one helper of all things so here she is helping me to open my Amazon box.
    </p6>   
    <!--Travelling-->
    <h2><u>Travelling</u></h2>
    <p7>In 2025 I took upwards of ten flights! Most of them were for work purposes but a few were
        just for me. I travel back to Toronto often to visit my family. I am not a big fan of 
        heights and flying but I conquer my fears to be able to get from point A to B. 
    </p7>

    <p8>This is my window seat view above the clouds from one of the flights I took in 2025.
