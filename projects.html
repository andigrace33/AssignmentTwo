    <h2>Take a look at some of the projects I am working on:</h2>
    <!--tomato plant-->
    <h2><u>Growing a tomato plant</u></h2>
    <p1>I started this tomato plant from seed last spring. It has grown so tall
        it is now touching the ceiling. The plant has produced cherry tomatoes
        and they are incredibly sweet.

    <!--degree-->
    <h2><u>Finishing a second degree</u></h2>
    <p3>I was accepted into the accelerated Computer Science program
        at Algoma U. My first degree was a BA in Political Science
        at York University. I consider this to be a project of mine
        because I work very hard at it. I do not come from a coding or math
        background so it has been very challenging for me.

    <!--family party-->
    <h2><u>Planning a family party</u></h2>
    <p5>I am planning a familiy party for this year's Family Day. I am going to introduce
        my partner to my family for the first time. My grandma is ordering traditional
        Carribean food for the gathering. I am very excited!

    <!--running group-->
    <h2><u>Starting a running group</u></h2>
    <p7>I have moved a lot in the past few years but I have finally found myself
        somewhat settled in a small town in Saskatchewan. I decided to start a 
        running group here to make some new friends. The group is called
        Kilometres and Friends. 
    </p7>
