    <p1>Welcome to my portfolio. Please feel free to explore to learn
        more about me. In the past 4 years I have moved from Ontario to 
        Alberta and then again from Alberta to Saskatchewan. I am a full time dreamer. I love to plan for the future
        and do as much as I can with the time that I have. I love my family and my friends and I do my best to stay 
        connected with them despite the distance and time zone differences. My favourite quote is,
        "you would give up everything you have to have your life be exactly as it is right now". I try to live in the moment
        and I hope this website reflects that! Thanks for reading.
